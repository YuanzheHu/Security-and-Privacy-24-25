# Security-and-Privacy-24-25: Smart Company Chat and File Sharing Application

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that provides the following features:

- **Chat System**: Users can send, edit, and delete messages.
- **File Management**: Users can upload and download files.
- **Admin Controls**: Admins can manage users, delete messages, and remove files.

---

## Installation and Usage

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Database

Before running the application, initialize the database:

```bash
python init_db.py
```

### Step 3: Start the Application

Run the Flask server:

```bash
python run.py
```

The application will be available at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## Potential Security Vulnerabilities

If not properly secured, the application may be vulnerable to the following security threats:

### SQL Injection (SQLi)
- If user input is directly embedded in SQL queries without sanitization, attackers can manipulate the database.
- **Example Attack**: Logging in with the following input may bypass authentication:
  ```sql
  ' OR 1=1 --
  ```
- **Mitigation**: Use prepared statements (e.g., SQLAlchemy ORM) to avoid direct query execution.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- If user-generated content (e.g., chat messages) is not sanitized, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript.
- **Example Attack**: Sending the following message in chat:
  ```html
  <script>alert('XSS')</script>
  ```
- **Mitigation**: Escape and sanitize user input before rendering it in HTML. Use libraries like Flask-Talisman.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- If forms lack CSRF protection, attackers can trick users into performing unintended actions (e.g., deleting messages).
- **Example Attack**: A malicious website can send a request on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Mitigation**: Use CSRF tokens (Flask-WTF provides built-in protection).

### Unrestricted File Uploads
- If uploaded files are not validated, attackers can upload malicious scripts (e.g., `.exe`, `.php`).
- **Example Attack**: Uploading a `.php` file and executing it on the server.
- **Mitigation**: Restrict file types and scan uploads before saving.

### Insecure Session Management
- If session tokens are predictable or not properly secured, attackers can hijack sessions.
- **Example Attack**: Stealing a session cookie via XSS and gaining unauthorized access.
- **Mitigation**: Use secure cookies, HTTPS, and set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` attributes.

### Brute Force & Weak Passwords
- If there is no rate limiting, attackers can attempt unlimited login attempts.
- **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting (Flask-Limiter), enforce strong passwords, and use bcrypt for password hashing.

---

## Security Recommendations

To protect against these attacks, consider implementing the following:

- Use **Flask-WTF** for CSRF protection.
- Use **Flask-Bcrypt** or **Argon2** for password hashing.
- Sanitize and escape user input to prevent XSS.
- Implement **prepared statements** to prevent SQL Injection.
- Restrict file uploads to specific types and scan them before storage.
- Use **HTTPS** and secure cookies for session management.
- Implement **rate limiting** to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Whatâ€™s Improved?

- Added a **"Potential Security Vulnerabilities"** section outlining major attack vectors.
- Provided real-world examples of attacks (**SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, File Upload exploits**).
- Suggested **security best practices** to mitigate these risks.
- Kept the README **professional, structured, and informative**.
